# Authentication System using Redux and Next.js

This project is a simple username/password authentication system using Redux for state management and Next.js for both the front-end and back-end. The system includes API endpoints secured with bearer token authentication and a custom `useAuthSession` hook to manage the user's session on the client side.

## Features

1. **Authentication System**: User login and session management using JWT.
2. **API Endpoints**: Secure API endpoints accessible only to authenticated users.
3. **State Management**: Redux is used for managing the application's state.
4. **Custom Hook**: `useAuthSession` for managing user sessions.
5. **Validation and Notifications**: Form validation and toast notifications for errors and successful login
